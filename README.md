Using Sinatra to create a simple web page that displays recipes and instructions. The users can signup, login and logout. The app validates the data by email and password, the bcrypt gem is used to store a hashed and salted password. The user can't sign up without filling all the fields. After signup/login the user has options to list all recipes they made or create a new one. The option to logout is also provided. The recipes are CRUD, in the app all the forms are available.
